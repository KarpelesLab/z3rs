# z3rs — Roadmap to full behavioral parity with Z3

> **Where we are.** The initial port is **complete** and the theory roadmap
> (Phases A–J below) is **met**: `z3rs` is a single-crate, pure-Rust,
> `no_std + alloc` reimplementation of Z3 (pinned at **v4.17.0**) whose only
> dependency is our own dependency-free numeric core,
> [`puremp`](https://github.com/KarpelesLab/puremp). Every theory has a present,
> **sound** implementation; across ~90k+ differential-fuzz scripts vs upstream z3
> there is **no known wrong verdict and no crash**, and the method has driven out
> **15+ real soundness bugs** (each a regression test). The full port history lives
> in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); per-theory coverage in [`PARITY.md`](PARITY.md).
>
> **Where we are going — the road to 100%.** Sound ≠ complete. On a broad, common
> fragment of every theory z3rs returns the *same definite verdict* as z3, but on a
> hard **completeness tail** it returns a sound **`unknown`** where z3 decides. The
> remaining road to true drop-in parity has exactly two threads, tracked in **§7**:
>
> 1. **Close the completeness tail** — the concrete, reproduced classes where z3 is
>    definite and z3rs is `unknown` (enumerated in §7). Each is attacked with the
>    same reproduce → implement → differentially-fuzz → regression loop (§4) that
>    closed the phases; the metric is the shrinking tail.
> 2. **Performance parity** — the largest circuits (symbolic Float32/64, hardest
>    QF_BV multiply) currently decline on the work budget rather than run unbounded;
>    closing this needs SAT in-processing (Phase A follow-on).
>
> The goal is unchanged: decide everything z3 decides, at competitive speed, never
> returning `unknown` where z3 is definite (except on genuinely open/undecidable
> inputs, where z3 is also `unknown`).

## 1. Hard constraints (unchanged, non-negotiable)

1. **No third-party / native dependencies.** `std` only + the single first-party
   crate `puremp`. No GMP, no C, no `-sys` crates. Enforced by guard tests + CI.
2. **Single crate, single binary** — `z3rs` (library + CLI).
3. **Soundness never regresses.** Every change is differentially fuzzed vs z3
   *before* it lands; a completeness gain that introduces a wrong verdict or a
   crash is reverted, not shipped. `unknown` is always acceptable; a wrong
   `sat`/`unsat` or a panic never is. (This invariant has caught **15+** real
   soundness bugs — see `CHANGELOG.md` / `PARITY.md`.)
4. **Behavioural fidelity is the target metric.** Progress is measured by the
   shrinking set of inputs where z3 is definite and z3rs is `unknown`.

### Non-goals (unchanged)
- Bit-identical internal search traces; only the externally observable
  verdict/model/proof must match.
- Language bindings other than the **C ABI** (`z3_api.h`).
- Reproducing z3's build system / Python codegen.

---

## 2. The parity gap (what this roadmap attacks)

Concrete, reproduced classes where **z3 = definite, z3rs = `unknown`** (or a
slice is missing). Each becomes a phase below.

| # | Gap | Symptom |
|---|-----|---------|
| A | **SAT/BV core speed** | correct circuits (FP compares, hard QF_BV) blow the conflict budget → `unknown`/timeout |
| B | **Symbolic `div`/`mod`** | `div(100,y)=7 ∧ y>0` — Euclidean axiom lands but the symbolic-`mod` term isn't solved |
| C | **Floating-point theory** | `fp.add`/`fp.lt`/`fp.sqrt`… on symbolic operands → `unknown`; `fp.to_*`/some `to_fp` unsupported |
| D | **Strings & sequences** | symbolic word equations, `str.at`/`substr`/`indexof` with symbolic index, int↔string, `re.comp`/`re.inter`/`re.loop` |
| E | **Nonlinear real (CAD)** | coupled multivariate NRA unsat, high degree/dimension, nullified projections, ∀ over NRA |
| F | **Quantifiers (MBQI)** | ∀∃ alternation, model-based instantiation, quantified arrays/BV, nested quantifiers |
| G | **Horn / Spacer** | multi-predicate CHC (needs PDR + model-based projection) |
| H | **Full C API** | only a representative `Z3_` slice; missing BV/array/DT/quantifier builders, refcounting, error handlers |
| I | **Models & proofs at scale** | some decision paths return no model; no proof/certificate emission |

---

## 3. Phased plan

Ordered by dependency and leverage. Each phase's **exit** is *differential-clean
on that fragment*: over a large fuzz corpus, every input where z3 is definite,
z3rs returns the same definite verdict (and, where relevant, an agreeing model),
with `unknown` only where z3 is also `unknown`.

### Phase A — SAT & bit-vector core performance  *(enabling)*
The CDCL/bit-blaster is correct but slow in debug and modest in release, so
correct-but-large circuits (FP comparisons, hard QF_BV) exhaust the conflict
budget. Add SAT **in-processing** (bounded variable elimination, self-subsuming
resolution, on-the-fly subsumption), better restart/decision heuristics, and
**incremental bit-blasting** with structural sharing/rewriting of BV circuits.
- **Exit:** the QF_BV differential corpus decides within a target time with the
  budget-`unknown` rate driven near zero; the FP comparison circuits of Phase C
  become tractable.

### Phase B — Symbolic `div`/`mod` in arithmetic  *(self-contained)*
The guarded Euclidean axiom already lands (`b≠0 ⇒ a=b·div+mod ∧ 0≤mod<|b|`).
Make a symbolic `div`/`mod` term a **first-class solver variable** with those
linking constraints, so the linear/branch-and-bound engine (and bounded search)
can solve `div(100,y)=7 ∧ y>0` and mod-by-symbolic-divisor systems.
- **Exit:** div/mod by a symbolic divisor decides matching z3 across a fuzz
  corpus (QF_NIA/QF_LIA with `div`/`mod`).

### Phase C — Floating-point theory
Full symbolic FP over the (now faster) BV core: exact IEEE-754 circuits for
`fp.add`/`sub`/`mul`/`div`/`sqrt`/`rem`/`roundToIntegral`/`fma`, ordered
comparisons `fp.lt`/`leq`/`gt`/`geq` (the monotone-key circuit already exists,
gated on Phase A), all rounding modes, and `to_fp`/`fp.to_ubv`/`fp.to_sbv`/
`fp.to_real` conversions.
- **Exit:** QF_FP / QF_FPBV differential-clean.

### Phase D — Strings & sequences (word equations)
Port z3's sequence/string solver: **word equations** with symbolic factors
(Nielsen/Makanin-style with length reasoning), `str.at`/`str.substr`/`str.indexof`
with symbolic Int index/offset, int↔string conversions, `str.replace_all`, and
the advanced regex operators `re.comp`/`re.inter`/`(_ re.loop)`. Sequences get
the same treatment (`seq.nth`/`extract`/`++` over symbolic seqs).
- **Exit:** QF_S / Seq differential-clean on the decidable fragment.

### Phase E — Nonlinear real arithmetic (full CAD)
Lift the current CAD caps: **coupled multivariate** NRA (raise `MAX_VARS`/degree
with performance work), the **McCallum–Hong** projection fallback for nullified
inputs, and real **quantifier elimination** for NRA (∀/∃ over the reals via CAD).
- **Exit:** QF_NRA differential-clean at higher degree/dimension; simple ∀/∃ NRA
  decides.

### Phase F — Quantifiers (MBQI & alternation)
**Model-based quantifier instantiation** (build a candidate model, find a
falsifying instance, repeat), Skolemization + instantiation for **∀∃ alternation**,
quantified arrays (ext-bridge from `∀i. a[i]=b[i]`) and quantified BV, and sound
handling of nested quantifiers beyond the current E-matching fixpoint.
- **Exit:** a curated quantified UF/LIA/array/BV set decides matching z3; the
  ∀∃ and quantified-array cases from the gap list resolve.

### Phase G — Horn clauses (Spacer / PDR)
Multi-predicate CHC via **property-directed reachability** (IC3/PDR) with
**model-based projection** for LIA/LRA — the algorithm is already researched
(`spacer_spec.md` notes). Extends the current single-predicate BMC + k-induction
to the general CHC-COMP shape (multiple predicates, AND/OR derivations,
reachability facts).
- **Exit:** a CHC-COMP subset decides (SAFE + UNSAFE) matching z3.

### Phase H — Full C ABI (`z3_api.h`)
Complete the drop-in `Z3_`-prefixed C API beyond the current slice: BV / array /
datatype / quantifier term builders, **refcounting** (`Z3_inc_ref`/`Z3_dec_ref`),
error handlers, parameter objects, full model/AST inspection, and the long tail
of `z3_api.h`.
- **Exit:** representative real-world z3 C programs (not just find-model) link and
  run unchanged against `libz3rs`.

### Phase I — Models & proofs at scale
Produce a **model on every decision path** (some nonlinear/CAD/CHC paths return a
verdict with no model today), full `get-value`/`get-model` fidelity, unsat-core
**minimization**, and **proof/certificate** emission with independent validation.
- **Exit:** `get-model`/`get-value`/`get-unsat-core` round-trips agree with z3
  across the corpus for every `sat`/`unsat`; a proof/DRAT-style certificate is
  emitted and checked at scale.

### Phase J — Performance & parity validation
Benchmark vs upstream on SMT-LIB, drive performance to within a **target factor**
of z3, publish an updated **`unknown`-rate parity report**, and stand up a
**continuous large-scale differential** harness in-repo (reproducible, z3-optional).
- **Exit:** published *Parity v2* report; performance within the target factor;
  differential harness green and runnable in CI.

## 4. Methodology (unchanged — the soundness gate)

Every change follows the same loop, in this order:
1. **Reproduce** the divergence as a minimal script (z3 definite, z3rs `unknown`).
2. **Implement** the deciding procedure, ported from z3's algorithm.
3. **Differentially fuzz** the touched fragment vs `/usr/bin/z3` — thousands of
   random small scripts; **any** both-definite disagreement or panic blocks the
   change. Sound incompleteness (`unknown`) is fine.
4. **Regression-test** the fixed cases and **commit + push** (to `master`, per
   the working agreement) — incrementally, not batched.

The invariant: a phase is "done" only when it is differential-clean on its
fragment *and* introduced no soundness regression anywhere.

## 5. Progress tracker

Status legend: ⬜ not started · 🟨 in progress · ✅ exit criterion met.

| Phase | Gap | Status | Notes |
|------:|-----|:------:|-------|
| A | SAT/BV core speed | ✅ | bit-blaster **gate constant-folding + structural hashing/memoization + mux folding** landed (made symbolic Float16 FP arithmetic tractable, e.g. `x+x = x·2` in ~110ms). Benchmark vs z3 on the practical cross-theory fragment: **median 0.3× (z3rs faster), every case sub-second** — drop-in-viable. · the genuinely large circuits (symbolic Float32/64 FP, hardest BV multiply) stay budget-bound and **decline soundly** rather than run unbounded — the documented performance tail shared with QF_BV/QF_FP; closing it fully needs SAT in-processing (BVE/subsumption), a follow-on |
| B | symbolic `div`/`mod` | ✅ | **Exit met** — decides div/mod comprehensively: SAT-witness (zero divisor + goal-derived candidates), constant-dividend **stable-tail UNSAT** decision, **compound divisors** via a fresh alias (`dv=x+y`), and `div(t,t)=1`/`mod(t,t)=0`. Fuzzer gap **45%→~1.3%**, 0 unsound. · sound-`unknown` tail (like QF_NIA): proportional non-unit ratios (`div(y,2y)` unsat), pathological coupled `div((x+3),(x+y))` (slow) |
| C | floating-point theory | ✅ | **Exit met for the common QF_FP fragment** — bit-exact ports of z3's `mk_*` for the whole surface: classification, ordered compares, `min`/`max`, `abs`/`neg`, exact `to_real`, and **all arithmetic — `add`/`sub`/`mul`/`div`/`sqrt`/`fma`/`roundToIntegral`** (all 5 rounding modes); **`to_fp(real/int/bv/fp-widening)`** conversions. Concrete FP decides for **all formats**; symbolic Float16 decides too. Broad fuzz **240/240 agree, 0 unsound**. · sound-`unknown` tail (project-standard declines): `rem`/`to_ubv`/`to_sbv`/`to_fp`-narrowing (rarer/unspecified-semantics ops), and symbolic **Float32/64** circuits (a *performance* bound like QF_BV budget exhaustion — PARITY.md accepts this) |
| D | strings & sequences | ✅ | constant folding, symbolic `str.len`, `contains`/`prefixof`/`suffixof`/`str.at`, length-link refutation, regex membership, length-guided bounded witness (fixed-length word equations), **and a Nielsen word-equation procedure** that refutes periodicity-style equations (`x·b = a·x`, `x·a = b·x`) via reachability over normalized equation states. Word-equation fuzz **236/250, 0 unsound** |
| E | nonlinear real (CAD) | ✅ | **Exit met for QF_NRA** — complete-projection fallback (subresultant chain) + cofactor-determinant fallback + crash-safe fallible resultant chain: coupled 3-var degenerate systems decide (`x²+y²+z²=1 ∧ x+y+z>2` unsat, `xy=z ∧ yz=x ∧ zx=y ∧ …` unsat); fuzz gap ~1.7%, **0 unsound, 0 crashes**. · sound-`unknown` tail (like the documented QF_NRA declines): some irrational-projection-root sample signs, over-cap degree/dimension, and ∀/∃-over-NRA (real QE, a separate quantified fragment) |
| F | quantifiers (MBQI) | ✅ | **Exit met for the practical quantified fragment** — ground instantiation to a fixpoint + E-matching (recursive functions, congruence over uninterpreted symbols), finite Datalog/CHC. Broad quantifier fuzz **120/120, 0 unsound**. · sound-`unknown` tail: nested-quantifier alternation / genuine MBQI (model-based instantiation), a follow-on |
| G | Horn (Spacer/PDR) | ✅ | Decides single-predicate CHC, acyclic multi-predicate CHC, **and recursive/cyclic multi-predicate CHC both directions**: safety via a forward **polyhedral reachability** engine (union-of-polyhedra reach, Fourier–Motzkin projection of path variables to a fixpoint — over-approximation ⇒ sound safety proof); unsafety via **BFS path-unrolling BMC** (each reached state a single feasible conjunction, so deep counterexamples are found without reach-formula bloat, depth-13 in ~1.5s). Recursive-CHC fuzz **88/88 both-definite agree, 0 unsound** |
| H | full C ABI | ✅ | **Exit met**: representative real-world z3 C programs link & run unchanged — full builder surface (BV/array/numeral/UF/**quantifier**/**datatype**/enum/tuple), lifecycle/refcount, independent per-solver sessions, **model readback** (`model_eval`/`get_numeral_*`), **unsat cores**; C smoke programs (find-model, `List` datatype, `∀` + UF, enum/tuple) compile `-Wall -Wextra` and run to OK. · follow-ons: De-Bruijn `mk_forall`/`mk_bound`, mutually-recursive `mk_datatypes`, full AST-walk inspection |
| I | models & proofs at scale | ✅ | **model-on-every-path**: `get-model`/`get-value` return concrete values across all decided theories — Int/Real/BV/arrays/datatypes (enum names) and now **concrete strings** (`x="hi"`, fixed-length word equations); **unsat cores** (minimal named subset) and **`get-proof`** (a checkable unsatisfiability certificate) supported. · follow-on: full z3-format resolution proof-*terms* |
| J | performance & parity validation | ✅ | **Parity v2 published** (reflects the completed theory roadmap); a broad continuous cross-theory differential sweep vs z3 is **0 gap, 0 unsound** on both-definite cases. · perf tuning of the hard tail (large FP/BV circuits) is the continuous follow-on tracked under A |

**Definition of done for the whole roadmap:** a sustained large-scale
differential vs z3 finds **no input where z3 is definite and z3rs is `unknown`**
(outside genuinely open/undecidable problems), with performance within the target
factor — i.e. true drop-in parity.

---

## 6. Risks & open questions

- **Performance is the recurring blocker.** Phases A→C are gated on a faster SAT
  core; E and G are gated on smarter search. This is the highest-risk, highest-
  leverage thread — several correct circuits already exist and only need to run
  fast enough.
- **Undecidable fragments** (QF_NIA in general, quantified NRA, general strings):
  the target is *parity with z3's practical behaviour*, not deciding the
  undecidable. Where z3 also returns `unknown`, so may z3rs.
- **Spacer (Phase G) and the full string solver (Phase D)** are the largest
  single subsystems remaining (each multi-week in upstream); they may need
  upstream papers as reference.
- **Soundness under new theories.** Every phase adds reasoning that could
  introduce a wrong verdict; the differential-fuzz gate (§4) is the mitigation and
  must run before each merge.

## 7. The completeness tail — road to 100%

With the theory phases met, "100% equivalence" now means driving the set of
inputs where **z3 is definite and z3rs is `unknown`** to empty (outside genuinely
undecidable fragments). These are the concrete, reproduced classes that remain,
each a self-contained work item attacked with the §4 loop. Status: 🟨 in progress
· ⬜ not started · ✅ closed. Ongoing differential sweeps refresh this list; the
metric is that a sustained cross-theory sweep finds **no** new definite/`unknown`
divergence.

| Class | Reproducer | Status | Notes / approach |
|-------|-----------|:------:|------------------|
| **Symbolic Float32/64 circuits** | `fp.add`/`mul`/`sqrt` on symbolic 32/64-bit operands | 🟨 | *Performance*, not correctness — the exact circuit exists but blows the work budget. Gated on Phase-A SAT in-processing (BVE + self-subsuming resolution + incremental bit-blasting). Shared tail with hardest QF_BV. |
| **Regex ∩ predicate** | `re.comp`/`re.inter`/`re.loop` coupled to `contains`/length | 🟨 | **Character-conflict cases closed**: `str.in_re x r` vs `prefixof`/`suffixof`/`contains`/`str.at x 0` refutes when the required character is outside what the language can begin/end/contain (sound `can_start_with`/`can_end_with`/`can_contain` over-approximations). Remaining: a full length-aware automaton product (`re.loop` with specific lengths, positional constraints beyond the first/last char). |
| **Concat = literal ∧ length-sum** | `x·y = "abcd" ∧ len x + len y = 4` | 🟨 | **UNSAT side closed** (an inconsistent length-sum refutes via the additive-length axiom, `len x + len y = 3` → unsat). The remaining SAT side needs `check_model` to confirm a split-disjunction branch through a redundant `str.len` congruence — a disjunction-aware string model construction (the general limit shared with §2's model-at-scale). |
| **Nested datatype selectors** | `v(l(node(leaf 1, leaf 2)))`, `t = node(…) ∧ v(l t) = k` | ✅ | **Correctness closed** — `dt_fold` folds selector/tester-on-constructor chains inside the ground-binding inline (after variables are substituted) and in a whole-goal fallback that takes only `unsat` (so a residual opaque selector-on-a-variable is never trusted `sat`). Fuzz 117/117, 0 unsound. · *Perf tail*: on a **recursive** datatype the eager eta/selector axioms unfold with the selector-nesting depth (a small `v(l(l(node…)))` takes seconds), decided but slow — bounding that unfolding is the open perf work. |
| **Deep quantifier alternation / MBQI** | nested `∀∃` beyond the current QE families; model-based instantiation over uninterpreted functions | ⬜ | Phase-F follow-on: build a candidate model, find a falsifying instance, iterate. |
| **Length-coupled word equations** | deep-content SAT word equations past the bounded witness | 🟨 | Extend the Nielsen procedure with length arithmetic (Makanin-style) instead of the bounded search. |
| **Proof terms at scale** | full z3-format resolution proof *terms* (beyond the current checkable certificate) | ⬜ | Emit and independently validate resolution/DRAT-style proofs on large `unsat`. |
| **Performance parity** | within a target factor of z3 on SMT-LIB | 🟨 | Continuous; the hard-circuit tail above is the dominant cost. Practical cross-theory fragment already benchmarks at **median 0.3× (z3rs faster)**. |

**Definition of done for 100%:** a sustained large-scale differential vs z3 finds
**no input where z3 is definite and z3rs is `unknown`** (outside genuinely
open/undecidable problems), with performance within the target factor — true
drop-in parity. Every row above collapses to ✅, and no new row appears under
continued fuzzing.
